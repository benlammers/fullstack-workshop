## Purpose
This repository contains example files and resources to go over features of JavaScript and more specifically newer methods available. This is not meant for someone beginning to learn to code but to get someone with experience in another language up to speed with how to use JavaScript in preparation for development within a framework such as React.

## Getting Started
### Requirements
- Experience using anther coding language such as Java, Python etc.
-  [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - Node JS is required to run JavaScript files
- Code editor such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Running JavaScript

### [TypeScript Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pZmKW9-I_k&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gUgr39Q_yD6v-bSyMwKPUI) - YouTube Playlist
**Author: Net Ninja**  
If you do not like the freedom that JavaScript gives as a loosely typed language then you should take a look at TypeScript. TypeScript is a language built upon JavaScript that as its name implies is strongly typed. This makes it harder to create simple errors and provides great auto-completion support in VS Code.
